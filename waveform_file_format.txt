The waveform file holds both settings and signal data. The first 800 bytes are for the settings. The settings are stored as little endian 32 bit integers.
Then follows the signal data for channel 1, which is 3000 bytes and after that 3000 bytes for the channel 2 data. All samples are single byte values.

The settings part holds the following data:
