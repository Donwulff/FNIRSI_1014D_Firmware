Added code to the auto setup function to switch back to AUTO mode. This is needed because in NORMAL or SINGLE mode it froze on using this function.
Also added some initialization code to have the scope start with a full screen when in NORMAL or SINGLE mode. Before, in this case, the signal part of the scope screen remained black in absense of a trigger.
